## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `yarn` (or `npm install` or `pnpm install`), start a development server:

```bash
yarn dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
yarn dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
yarn build
```

You can preview the production build with `yarn preview`.
